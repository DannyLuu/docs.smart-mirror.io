# Install Easily on Raspberry Pi 2 or 3
### Part 1 - Install Raspbian


{% hint style='warning' %}
These instructions are specific to the Raspberry Pi 2 and 3


* Step 1
    * To get started I suggest a clean install of Raspbian. You can snag a fresh copy of Jessie w/ Pixel [Raspbian Download Page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).  
Make sure to download the **Full desktop image**. 

    To make things easier you can now use NOOBS to install Raspbian. Few things regarding this... 

        1. Use NOOBS LITE -- This will require you to be connected to the internet but will also allow you to always install the newest version of Raspbian
        2. You still must install Raspbian Full. Don't use Raspbian Lite. There's a lot of differences between the two and its a nightmare getting the mirror running on Lite.
