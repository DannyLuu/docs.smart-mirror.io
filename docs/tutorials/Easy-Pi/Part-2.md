The easiest way to install the smart mirror is via the 1-line installation script for the Pi 2 and 3. This script will install the smart mirror and it's dependencies. 

## Step 1 - Open Terminal Window
Open the terminal in Raspbian. 

## Step 2 - Copy and past install script
Then copy and paste the install script within the code box below into the terminal.

```bash
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evancohen/smart-mirror/master/scripts/pi-install.sh | bash
```

Once that script finishes running (~15 minutes on a standard connection) you'll continue onto the next step.
