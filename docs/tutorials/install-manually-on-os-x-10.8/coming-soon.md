#Coming Soon

So, at the time of writing this I don't have a mac to create all the steps involved... A person familiar with OS X can probably sort this out using the linux install tutorial and changing some of the commands to apply to OS X. Until someone with a Mac creates this its going to just be in the coming soon status.
