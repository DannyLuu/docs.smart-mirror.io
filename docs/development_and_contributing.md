# Development and Contributing

##### Development
See the `dev` branch for features that are currently in development.
If you would like to contribue please follow the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
To launch the mirror with a debug window attached use the following command:
```
npm start dev
```
More info coming soon(ish). In the meantime head over to the [gitter chat](https://gitter.im/evancohen/smart-mirror) for help. 

##### Contributing
Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to smart-mirror. There is a lot to do...if you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on [smart-mirror.io](http://smart-mirror.io/)? If you are a developer and have a feature/capability you'd like to see, why not spent a couple of hours and help build it? 

The process is straight-forward.

 - Fork Smart Mirror [git repository](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror).
 - Write the code for your feature/capability.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/evancohen/smart-mirror/tree/dev) branch of the Smart Mirror.
