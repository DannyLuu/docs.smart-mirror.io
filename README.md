# Introduction

The smart-mirror was inspired by [HomeMirror](https://github.com/HannahMitt/HomeMirror) and Michael Teeuw's [Magic Mirror](http://michaelteeuw.nl/tagged/magicmirror). It was originally created in a weekend and is now maintained by a growing community of contributors and enthusiasts. 

The smart-mirror is voice controlled, integrates with a growing number of services, and can control your lights :)
