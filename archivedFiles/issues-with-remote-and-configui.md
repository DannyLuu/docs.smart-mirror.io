# Issues with Remote and ConfigUI

### Only "Loading..." displayed on ConfigUI Page 
Some people have stated that the ConfigUI page just says loading.
If you're having this issue you must use a newer browser. Most often this happens if you have an outdated version of Raspbian. If your version of Raspbian predates Raspbian Jessie W/PIXEL then we suggest following the steps in [How To Install Raspbian(full)](/docs/howto/how_to_install_raspbianfull.md). Following this solution has fixed this specific issue 100% of the time.
